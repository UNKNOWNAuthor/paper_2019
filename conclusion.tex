\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we first examine the overlooked problem of privacy-preserving uncertain graph sharing. 
We provide a generalized scheme, {\methodName}, which seamlessly integrates edge uncertainty into core anonymization steps.
The scheme uses a randomized algorithm boosted by the hybrid of utility-aware heuristics. 
It excels in identifying sanitized uncertain graphs with excellent quality. 
Experiments on three real-world datasets verify its effectiveness and practical utility.
There are many potentials to explore further.  
The independent model discussed in this work is one of the simplest models with uncertainty, it naturally ignores the correlation among various graph components. 
We leave the conditional probability model as a future extension. 
Another extension is to investigate sharing uncertain graphs in the differentially private manner.
